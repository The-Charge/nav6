nav6 Fuse Values

The nav6's ATMEGA328P microcontroller must be programmed with "FUSE" values.

Unlike the nav6 software, FUSE values are not stored within the ATMEGA328P's
Flash memory, but rather are stored in non-volatile internal processor storage.

The fuse values can be programmed into the ATMEGA328P 

There are three 8-bit FUSE values (Low, High and Extended)

The nav6 FUSE values are:

Low  = 0xFF


High = 0xDE

Extended = 0x05
